Artificial neural networks are one of the main tools used in machine learning. 
As the “neural” part of their name suggests, they are brain-inspired systems which are
intended to replicate the way that we humans learn. Neural networks consist of input and 
output layers, as well as (in most cases) a hidden layer consisting of units that transform 
the input into something that the output layer can use. They are excellent tools for finding 
patterns which are far too complex or numerous for a human programmer to extract and teach 
the machine to recognize.

Steps in ANN:

step 1 : Randomly initialize the weight to small number close to 0 (but not 0)

step 2: Input the first observation of your dataset in the input layer, each feature is one input node

step 3: Forward Propagation

step 4: Compare the result and measure generated error

step 5: Back Propagation

step 6: find the model which create minimum error
